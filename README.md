# swat-flow-tool

> A Flow Tool Project

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
yarn install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
yarn run dev - This will allow for hot reload upon saving changes.

# run app from local 
There is no longer a need to run second console. through vue CLI 3 the hot reload happens within first window. 

For a detailed explanation on how things work, check out the [guide](http://vuejs-templates.github.io/webpack/) and [docs for vue-loader](http://vuejs.github.io/vue-loader).

S.W.A.T. tool for T1 and T2 work flow

An S.F.T. (SWAT FLOW TOOL) is designed to refine the SWAT Flow Chart into a small footprint standalone application that will serve the same purpose but without requiring multiple tabs and windows keeping the flowchart at the agent’s fingertips. Not every agent can memorize every url we need to do our jobs, not every agent keeps organized tabs in their browsers, most agents are rather disorganized when it comes to keeping tabs open and accessible.

By creating a standalone application it allows for there to be a specific and dialed focus on the troubleshooting flow where the agent is focused on the specific results of their query. This would be the short term focus of the tool. Long term focus would be to build in additional functionality that would streamline the setup and readiness of the T1 / T2 agent as they are introduced into this roll.

Goals:

    Streamline flowchart
    Decrease pre-transfer call time for T1 agents
    Increase speed of knowledge gained
    Add more direct access to more tools and knowledge
    Increase agent accountability to the knowledge
